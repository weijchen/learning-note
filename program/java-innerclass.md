# Nested classes
    * Four types of nested classes in Java:
        1. Static nested classes
        2. Nonstatic nested classes = inner class
        3. Local classes, an inner class that's defined inside of a scope block which is usually a method.
        4. Anonymous classes, which is a nested class without a class name
